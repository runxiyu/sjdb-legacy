		How can we know that current knowledge is an improvement on past knowledge?
	</li>
	<ul><li>
		We can think about the discovery and development of DNA, considering Phoebus Levene's tetranucleotide hypothesis to Erwin Chargaff's analysis of nucleotide composition to the well-known Hershy and Chase experiment. There are more examples! Science is a route of discovery that builds on previous knowledge, either digging deeper or competely repudiates it. If you are interested in learning DNA's dicovery, you may read <a href="https://www.dna-worldwide.com/resource/160/history-dna-timeline">this website</a>!

		Are some things unknowable?
	</li>
	<ul><li>
		There are many theories for things we are don't really know. For instance, is there really life on other planets? How do our cells work like this? Why is everything such a coincidence? We don't really know about these things because we don't have direct evidence to prove and observe it. However, because the theory predicts and explains the observations, we hold it to be a pragmatic truth - one that works. For instance, <a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/it-takes-teamwork-how-endosymbiosis-changed-life-on-earth/evidence-for-endosymbiosis/">endosymbiosis theory</a> provide us with insights into how chloroplasts and mitochondria are engulfed by our selves when they were a bacteria. Scientists observed the size of ribosomes and the circular DNA found in chloroplasts and mitochondria and showed a resemblance to bacteria, indicating that at some point in evolution, cells engulfed these bacteria to work together! Yet, we won't be able to know if this really happens unless we can time travel to the past.

<h3>Artist of the Week 每周艺术家</h3>
<p><b>Oskar Schlemmer</b></p>

<p>
	Oskar Schlemmer (1888-1943) was a German painter, sculptor and performer. During the 1920s, he taught at the Bauhaus school, an avant-garde German art academy that combined fine arts with principles of mass production and function. Schlemmer was pioneer within the Bauhaus as someone who bridged abstract and representational art as well as traditional performance with modern art. 
</p>
<p>
	In his paintings, Schlemmer explored abstract forms with the human body; retaining the underlying human structure while depicting people as almost architectural constructs, in paintings such as the Bauhaus Stairway. In performances, Schlemmer similarly ought to modernize traditional art forms with pieces like his Triadic Ballet, where dancers adorned geometric, faceless costumes and performed to emphasize their forms and movements without a central narrative.

	The protagonist in our exhibition finds love hiding in plain sight. She undertakes intensely personal forays into the noise and bleeds of archives, and stares at suspended helicopters. She hangs her washing on a fighter plane, and watches oil slicks stain the earth with her eyes wide shut. She listens to fossils and stumbles onto ghosts in corridors, mulling over stubbornness, cutting short journeys, decoding mishaps, planting rice, cleaning up after explosions. She finds herself investigating a black hole in the back street of a small town and the trough of a panorama hollowed out of a landscape in the wake of a mine. She refuses to accept simple answers.
</p>
<p>
	Where does this place our sense of the centre of the contemporary world-question? As in, what is our sense of the contemporary world that has lost its centre?
</p>
<p>
	Questions exist because answers do not end a conversation. The questioning of what it means to simply "be" exists because we can never be satisfied by the mere assertion of being. Every desire is a question and a tussle between what we are, and what we can become. So let us ask again, Why Not Ask Again.
