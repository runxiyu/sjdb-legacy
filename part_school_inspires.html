<h3>Philosophical Quote of the Week 每周哲学引言</h3>
<blockquote>
	<p>The poet, who speaks in the name of a creative power, capable of overturning all orders and representations in order to affirm difference in the state of permanent revolution which characterizes eternal return; and that of the politician, who is above all concerned to deny that which 'differs,' so as to conserve or prolong an established historical order, or to establish a historical order which already calls forth in the world the forms of its representation.</p><cite>— Gilles Deleuze</cite>
