<p>This is a disaster. Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is Monday too.</p>

<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Song of the Worms</b><br><cite>Margaret Atwood</cite></p>
<p>We have been underground too long,<br>
we have done our work.<br>
we are many and one,<br>
we remember when we were human</p>
<p>We have lived among roots and stones,<br>
we have sung but no one has listened,<br>
we come into the open air<br>
at night only to love</p>
<p>which disgusts the soles of boots,<br>
their leather strict religion.</p>
<p>We know what a boot looks like<br>
when seen from underneath,<br>
we know the philosophy of boots,<br>
their metaphysic of kicks and ladders.<br>
We are afraid of boots<br>
but contemptuous of the foot that needs them.</p>
<p>Soon we will invade like weeds,<br>
everywhere but slowly;<br>
the captive plants will rebel<br>
with us, fences will topple,<br>
brick walls ripple and fall,</p>
<p>there will be no more boots.<br>
Meanwhile we eat dirt<br>
and sleep; we are waiting<br>
under your feet.</p>
<p>When we say Attack<br>
you will hear nothing<br>
at first.</p>
