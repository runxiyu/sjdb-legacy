<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Speech to the Young<br>
Speech to the Progress-Toward<br>
<small>(Among them Nora and Henry III)</small></b><br>
<cite>Gwendolyn Brooks</cite></p>
<p>Say to them,<br>
say to the down-keepers,<br>
the sun-slappers,<br>
the self-soilers,<br>
the harmony-hushers,<br>
"Even if you are not ready for day<br>
it cannot always be night."<br>
You will be right.<br>
For that is the hard home-run.</p>
<p>Live not for battles won.<br>
Live not for the-end-of-the-song.<br>
Live in the along.</p>
