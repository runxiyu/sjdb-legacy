<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Harlem</b><br><cite>Langston Hughes</cite></p>
<p>What happens to a dream deferred?</p>
<p>Does it dry up<br>
like a raisin in the sun?<br>
Or fester like a sore—<br>
And then run?<br>
Does it stink like rotten meat?<br>
Or crust and sugar over—<br>
like a syrupy sweet?</p>
<p>Maybe it just sags<br>
like a heavy load.</p>
<p><em>Or does it explode?</em></p>

<h3>TOK of the Week 每周知识论</h3>
<p><b>TOK and ESS</b></p>
<p><b>Environmental Value System (EVS)</b> is a particular worldview or set of paradigms that shapes the way an individual or a group of people perceive and evaluate environmental issues.</p>
<p>Based on how different people view environmental issues, we can categorize the worldviews:
<ul>
	<li>Ecocentrism is the worldview that puts nature as the most important factor, believing that humans are part of nature and should respect nature.</li>
	<li>Anthropocentrism is the worldview that weighs humans above nature, in which humans are the most important factors to consider.</li>
	<li>Technocentrism is the worldview that believes all problems can be solved by advancements in technology, putting humans on top of nature.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>An individual's EVS may be influenced by multiple factors, including personal experiences and external influences. Education, family, friends, religion, media, life experiences, and historical influences are all potential factors. For example, Buddhism focuses on the connection between humans and nature, which may lead a person to make choices that will not harm the environment.</p>
<p>Historical influences and media influences may include the disasters linked to environmental issues (e.g., <i>Chernobyl</i>, <i>Minamata</i>) and the publishment of environment-related books and documentaries (e.g., <i>Silent Spring</i>, <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>). The disasters make people aware of the consequences of irresponsible actions that have harmed the environment and therefore will change their perspective when facing environmental issues. The media may also call for action and inform people about the issues that are present, such as climate change.</p>
