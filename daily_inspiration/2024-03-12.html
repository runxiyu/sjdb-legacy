<h3>Lyric of the Day 每日歌词</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Legacy. What is a legacy?<br>
It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see<br>
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me<br>
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me<br>
You let me make a difference<br>
A place where even orphan immigrants<br>
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up<br>
I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up<br>
Wise up. Eyes up<br>
I catch a glimpse of the other side<br>
Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side<br>
My son is on the other side<br>
He’s with my mother on the other side<br>
Washington is watching from the other side</p>
<p>Teach me how to say goodbye</p>
<p>Rise up, rise up, rise up<br>
Eliza</p>
<p>My love, take your time<br>
I’ll see you on the other side<br>
Raise a glass to freedom...</p>
