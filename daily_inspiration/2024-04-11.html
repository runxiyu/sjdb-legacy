<p><b>No Breathing in Class</b><br>
<cite>Michael Rosen</cite></p>
<p>Maybe you think you have a teacher<br>
who's really strict<br>
maybe you know a really strict teacher.<br>
But when I was at school<br>
we had a teacher who was so strict<br>
you weren't allowed to breathe in her lessons.</p>
<p>That's true. We weren't allowed to breathe.<br>
It was really hard to get through<br>
a whole day without breathing.<br>
Lips tightly shut.<br>
Face going red.<br>
Eyeballs popping out.<br>
She'd go round the class glaring at us<br>
and then she'd suddenly catch sight of one of us</p>
<p>and she'd yell<br>
<span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">No breathing. Do you hear me? No breathing.</span></p>
<p>And you had to stop breathing right away.<br>
The naughty ones used to try and take quick secret breaths<br>
under the table.</p>
<p>They'd duck down where she couldn't see them</p>
<p>snatch a quick breath and come back up<br>
with their mouth shut tight.<br>
Then someone would say,<br>
"Excuse me, miss, can I go outside and do some breathing?"</p>
<p>And she'd say<br>
<span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">"What? Can't you wait? You've had all playtime to breathe, haven't you?".</span><br>
And then she'd ask someone a question<br>
like, "Where's Tibet?"<br>
and someone'd put their hand and say<br>
"Er... it's –"<br>
and she'd be right in there with:<br>
<span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">"You're breathing! I saw you breathe"</span><br>
"I wasn't, miss, really I wasn't."<br>
<span style="font-variant-caps: small-caps;">"Well, you are now, aren't you?"</span><br>
It was terrible.<br>
She was so strict...</p>
