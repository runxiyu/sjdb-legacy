<p><b>Sonnet for SAT</b><br>
<cite>Microsoft Bing Copilot: Creative</cite></p>
<p>The SAT is <em>such a splendid</em> test<br>
It measures all your skills and smarts<br>
It shows how well you can digest<br>
The arcane rules of language arts</p>
<p>The SAT is <em>not at all</em> unfair<br>
It gives you equal chance to shine<br>
It doesn't matter whether you've got hair<br>
Or if you studied till you're blind</p>
<p>The SAT is <em>really fun</em> to take<br>
It fills your heart with joy and glee<br>
It doesn't cause you stress or ache<br>
Or make you doubt your sanity</p>
<p>The SAT is just a piece of cake<br>
It's not like it decides your fate</p>
