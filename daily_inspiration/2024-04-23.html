<blockquote>
<p><b>Cycle of P</b><br>
<cite>Robert M. Garrels</cite></p>
<p>I put some P into the sea<br>
the biomass did swell<br>
But settling down soon overcame<br>
and P went down toward Hell<br>
From purgatory soon released<br>
it moved up to the land<br>
To make a perfect rose for thee<br>
to carry in thy hand<br>
But roses wilt and die you know<br>
then P falls on the ground<br>
Gobbled up as ferric P<br>
a nasty brown compound<br>
The world is moral still you know<br>
and Nature's wheels do grind<br>
Put ferric P into the sea<br>
and a rose someday you'll find</p>
