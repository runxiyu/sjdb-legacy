<blockquote>
<p><b>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening </b><br>
<cite>Robert Frost</cite></p>
<p>Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
His house is in the village though;<br> 
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
<p>My little horse must think it queer<br>
To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
The darkest evening of the year.</p>
<p>He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
The only other sound’s the sweep<br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
