<blockquote>
<p><small>Excerpt from</small><br><b>For the Fallen</b><br>
<cite>Laurence Binyon</cite></p>
<p>They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:<br>
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.<br>
At the going down of the sun and in the morning<br>
We will remember them.</p>
<p>But where our desires are and our hopes profound,<br>
Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,<br>
To the innermost heart of their own land they are known<br>
As the stars are known to the Night;</p>
<p>As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,<br>
Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain;<br>
As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,<br>
To the end, to the end, they remain.</p>
