<p>A mass die-off of fish in a reservoir in Vietnam's southern Dong Nai province has drawn attention to rising temperatures in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The reservoir's water level was too low for the fish to survive due to an intense drought that swept across southern Vietnam in April.</p>
<p>In addition, the reservoir had previously released water to save crops downstream, which may have contributed to the mass fish die-off.</p>
