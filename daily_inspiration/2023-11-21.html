<h3>Quote of the Day 每日引言</h3>
<p><b>The great civil war between Caesar and Pompey</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For famine only makes a city free;<br>
By gifts of food the tyrant buys a crowd<br>
To cringe before him: but a people starved<br>
Is fearless ever.
</p>
<p><cite>— Lucan</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quoted from The Pharsalia / De Bellum Civile, by Lucan. This book explores the themes of power, tyranny, and severed family bonds in the face of political avarice. Our familiar character, Julius Caesar, is portrayed in a way that contrasts to his usual glory and grandeur; instead, he is a bloodthirsty warmonger. There is no victor in a civil war.</p>
