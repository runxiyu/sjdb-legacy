<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>The Second Coming</b><br><cite>William Butler Yeats</cite></p>
<p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br>
The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br>
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br>
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br>
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br>
The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br>
The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br>
Are full of passionate intensity.</p>
<p>Surely some revelation is at hand;<br>
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br>
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br>
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br>
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br>
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br>
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br>
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br>
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br>
The darkness drops again; but now I know<br>
That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br>
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br>
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br>
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p>
