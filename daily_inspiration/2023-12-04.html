<p>This is a disaster. Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is Monday too.</p>

<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Mother to Son</b><br><cite>Langston Hughes</cite></p>
<p>Well, son, I'll tell you:<br>
Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.<br>
It's had tacks in it,<br>
And splinters,<br>
And boards torn up,<br>
And places with no carpet on the floor—<br>
Bare.<br>
But all the time<br>
I'se been a-climbin' on,<br>
And reachin' landin's,<br>
And turnin' corners,<br>
And sometimes goin' in the dark<br>
Where there ain't been no light.<br>
So boy, don't you turn back.<br>
Don't you set down on the steps<br>
'Cause you finds it's kinder hard.<br>
Don't you fall now—<br>
For I'se still goin', honey,<br>
I'se still climbin',<br>
And life for me ain't been no crystal stair.</p>
