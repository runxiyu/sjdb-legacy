<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Annabel Lee</b><br><cite>Edgar Allen Poe</cite></p>
<p>It was many and many a year ago,<br>
In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
By the name of Annabel Lee; —<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
Than to love and be loved by me.</p>
<p><em>I</em> was a child and <em>she</em> was a child,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea;<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love —<br>
I and my Annabel Lee —<br>
With a love that the wingéd seraphs in Heaven<br>
Coveted her and me.</p>
<p>And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her high-born kinsmen came<br>
And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea.</p>
<p>The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
Went envying her and me —<br>
Yes! — that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>
<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
Of those who were older than we —<br>
Of many far wiser than we —<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above,<br>
Nor the demons down under the sea,<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: —</p>
<p><p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: —<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
Of my darling — my darling — my life and my bride,<br>
In her sepulchre there by the sea —<br>
In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>
