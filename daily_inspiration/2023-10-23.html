<h3>Quote of the Day 每日引言</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We're the first species eveer consciously to be changing the atmosphere, knowingly warming it on a grand scale. For Earth, a warmer atmosphere will be nothing new, but for us humans, this is unchartered territory, because now we're in the vulnerable position of having placed ourselves at the mercy of the most fickle of all forces, the atmosphere.</p>
