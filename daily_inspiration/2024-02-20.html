<h3>Quote of the Day 每日引言</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is divine in man is elusive and impalpable, and he is easily tempted to embody it in a concrete form – a church, a country, a social system, a leader – so that he may realize it with less effort and serve it with more profit. Yet the attempt to externalize the kingdom of heaven in a temporal shape must end in disaster. It cannot be created by charters or constitutions nor established by arms.</p><p>
Those who seek for it alone will reach it together,<br>
and those who seek it in company will perish by themselves.</p>
