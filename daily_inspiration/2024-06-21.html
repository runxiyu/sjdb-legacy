<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Nothing Gold Can Stay</b><br>
<cite>Robert Frost</cite></p>
<p>Nature’s first green is gold,<br>
Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
Her early leaf’s a flower;<br>
But only so an hour.<br>
Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br>
So Eden sank to grief,<br>
So dawn goes down to day.<br>
Nothing gold can stay.</p>
