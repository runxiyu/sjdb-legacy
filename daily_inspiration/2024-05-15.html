<blockquote>
<p><b>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, (340)</b><br>
<cite>Emily Dickinson</cite></p>
<p>I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,<br>
And Mourners to and fro<br>
Kept treading - treading - till it seemed<br>
That Sense was breaking through -</p>
<p>And when they all were seated,<br>
A Service, like a Drum -<br>
Kept beating - beating - till I thought<br>
My mind was going numb -</p>
<p>And then I heard them lift a Box<br>
And creak across my Soul<br>
With those same Boots of Lead, again,<br>
Then Space - began to toll,</p>
<p>As all the Heavens were a Bell,<br>
And Being, but an Ear,<br>
And I, and Silence, some strange Race,<br>
Wrecked, solitary, here -</p>
<p>And then a Plank in Reason, broke,<br>
And I dropped down, and down -<br>
And hit a World, at every plunge,<br>
And Finished knowing - then -</p>
