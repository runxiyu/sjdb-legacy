<p><b>Funeral Blues</b><span class="ps">, with Context Clues</span>

<p><b>J<span style="font-size: smaller;">AMES</span></b>. Check!</p>
<p><b>R<span style="font-size: smaller;">ANSOM</span></b> <i>[looking for the first time towards the summit and seeing the <b>F<span style="font-size: smaller;">IGURE</span></b>]</i>. Look!</p>
<p><b>J<span style="font-size: smaller;">AMES</span></b>. Mate! I’ve won! <i>[The <b>F<span style="font-size: smaller;">IGURE</span></b> shakes its head.]</i></p>
<p><b>R<span style="font-size: smaller;">ANSOM</span></b> <i>[with his eyes still fixed upon it]</i>. But was the victory real?</p>
<p><b>J<span style="font-size: smaller;">AMES</span></b> <i>[half rising to his feet and tottering]</i>. <i>[In a choking voice.]</i> It was not Virtue—it was not Knowledge—it was Power! <i>[Collapses into his chair and falls forward over the chess table.]</i></p>
<p><b>C<span style="font-size: smaller;">HORUS</span></b>. What have you done? What have you done? You have killed, you have murdered her favourite son!</p>
<p><i>[A <b>F<span style="font-size: smaller;">IGURE</span></b> having the shape of the <b>A<span style="font-size: smaller;">BBOT</span></b>, wearing a monk’s habit and a judge’s wig, and holding the crystal in his hands, is illuminated at a somewhat higher level of the stage.]</i></p>
<p><b>A<span style="font-size: smaller;">BBOT</span></b>. I am truly sorry for this young man, but I must ask for the court to be cleared.</p>
<p><i>[The sound of a Blues is heard. Enter <b>L<span style="font-size: smaller;">ORD</span> S<span style="font-size: smaller;">TAGMANTLE</span></b> and <b>L<span style="font-size: smaller;">ADY</span> I<span style="font-size: smaller;">SABEL</span></b>, followed by Monks with a stretcher. The chess table is removed. <b>J<span style="font-size: smaller;">AMES’S</span></b> body is laid on the stretcher and carried in slow procession round the stage, disappearing into the darkness.]</i></p>
<p><b>S<span style="font-size: smaller;">TAGMANTLE</span></b> and <b>I<span style="font-size: smaller;">SABEL</span></b> <i>[together]</i>.<br>
	Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br>
	Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,<br>
	Silence the pianos and with muffled drum<br>
	Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.</p>

	<p>Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br>
	Scribbling on the sky the message: He is dead.<br>
	Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves.<br>
	Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.</p>

	<p>Hold up your umbrellas to keep off the rain<br>
	From Doctor Williams while he opens a vein;<br>
	Life, he pronounces, it is finally extinct.<br>
	Sergeant, arrest that man who said he winked!</p>

	<p>Shawcross will say a few words sad and kind<br>
	To the weeping crowds about the Master-Mind,<br>
	While Lamp with a powerful microscope<br>
	Searches their faces for a sign of hope.</p>

	<p>And Gunn, of course, will drive the motor-hearse:<br>
	None could drive it better, most would drive it worse.<br>
	He’ll open up the throttle to its fullest power<br>
	And drive him to the grave at <em>ninety miles an hour</em>.</p>

Michael Ransom (<b>R<span style="font-size: smaller;">ANSOM</span></b>): an experienced climber who leads a fatal expedition to the peak of F6 sponsored by the press and the government.<br>
Sir James Ransom (<b>J<span style="font-size: smaller;">AMES</span></b>): the twin brother of Michael Ransom, also the Foreign Secretary, who proposed the expedition and supposedly dies in this scene.</p>
<p class="ps">
Michael Ransom (<b>R<span style="font-size: smaller;">ANSOM</span></b>)：一名经验丰富的登山者。他在新闻界和政府的赞助下，带领团队前往 F6 峰，踏上致命的探险。<br>
Sir James Ransom (<b>J<span style="font-size: smaller;">AMES</span></b>)：Michael 的双胞胎兄弟，外交大臣。他提出了这场探险。在本段中，他 “去世” 了，《葬礼蓝调》讽刺他的 “死亡”。</p>
<p>This excerpt, taken from the final scene of the play <i>The Ascent of F6</i>, illustrates a hallucination in which a game of chess is played between Michael and James. At the end of this imaginary game, James dies, and the poem "Funeral Blues" is introduced. The last three stanzas are later replaced in the more popular version. The names mentioned in the last three stanzas are characters who have already sacrificed their lives for this meaningless imperialist expedition proposed by Sir James Ransom himself. In reality, instead of Sir James Ransom, Michael Ransom will soon join the list as he approaches the summit and the destined death.</p>
<p>Hope your M1 scores improve at <em>ninety miles an hour</em>!</p>
<p>本段选自戏剧《攀登 F6 高峰》的最后一幕，描绘了 Michael 和 James 下棋时产生的幻觉。在这场想象中的对弈结束后，James “去世”，诗歌《葬礼蓝调》由此问世。最后三节在现在脍炙人口的版本中被删去；这三节中提到的名字都是先前已经为 James 计划的这场帝国主义远征白白献出生命的人物。实际上，远在伦敦的 James 并未见到快到山顶的 Michael，Michael 却很快将走向注定的死亡。</p>
<p>不过，希望各位的 M1 成绩以 <em>90 英里每小时</em>的速度增长！</p>

<p>On this day in <date datetime="1861-10-10">1861</date>, the famous arctic explorer Fridtjof Nansen was born (see "On This Day" section). He won international fame after reaching a record northern latitude of 86°14′ during his <i>Fram</i> expedition of 1893–1896. Roald Amundsen was on this expedition. On <date datetime="1926-05-12">May 12th 1926</date>, Amundsen took off from the tower pictured in this photo in the airship <i>Norge</i>. This trip made him and 15 other men in the airship the first explorers verified to have reached the North Pole. The legacies of Nansen and Amundsen remain till today.</p>
<p><date datetime="1861-10-10">1861</date> 年的这一天，著名的北极探险家弗里德约夫·南森出生（见 "以史为鉴"）。他在 1893-1896 年的 Flam 探险中到达了创纪录的北纬 86°14′，从而赢得国际声誉。罗尔德·阿蒙森也参加了这次探险。<date datetime="1926-05-12">1926 年 5 月 12 日</date>，阿蒙森乘坐 Norge 飞艇从照片中的塔台起飞。这次旅行使他和飞艇上的其他 15 人成为第一批被证实到达北极点的探险家。南森和阿蒙森的传奇故事一直流传至今。</p>
