<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>In Flanders Fields</b><br>
<cite>John McCrae</cite></p>
<p> In Flanders fields the poppies blow<br>
Between the crosses, row on row,<br>
&emsp;That mark our place; and in the sky<br>
&emsp;The larks, still bravely singing, fly<br>
Scarce heard amid the guns below.</p>
<p>We are the dead. Short days ago<br>
We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,<br>
&emsp;Loved and were loved, and now we lie,<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In Flanders fields.</p>
<p>Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br>
To you from failing hands we throw<br>
&emsp;The torch; be yours to hold it high.<br>
&emsp;If ye break faith with us who die<br>
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br>
&emsp;&emsp;In Flanders fields.</p>
