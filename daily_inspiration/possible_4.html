<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Black Sun</b><br>
<cite>Osip Mandelstam</cite></p>
<p>This night is irredeemable.<br>
Where you are, it is still bright.<br>
At the gates of Jerusalem,<br>
a black sun is alight.</p>
<p>The yellow sun is hurting,<br>
sleep, baby, sleep.<br>
The Jews in the Temple’s burning<br>
buried my mother deep.</p>
<p>Without rabbi, without blessing,<br>
over her ashes, there,<br>
the Jews in the Temple’s burning<br>
chanted the prayer.</p>
<p>Over this mother,<br>
Israel’s voice was sung.<br>
I woke in a glittering cradle,<br>
lit by a black sun.</p>
