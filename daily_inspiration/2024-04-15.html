<p>Global warming has slowed the Earth's rotation slightly, which affects how we measure time.<p>
<p>As large masses of ice melt as a result of global warming, there will be less solid ice at the poles and more meltwater flowing around the equator.</p>
<p>This changes where the Earth's mass is concentrated, which affects the angular velocity of the Earth as it rotates.</p>
<p>Although other astronomical factors may counteract the effects of melting ice, experts predict that these effects will continue to have a profound impact in the future.</p>
