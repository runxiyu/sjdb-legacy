<p><b>We Have Not Long to Love</b><br>
<cite>Tenessee Williams</cite></p>
<p>We have not long to love.<br>
Light does not stay.<br>
The tender things are those<br>
we fold away.<br>
Coarse fabrics are the ones<br>
for common wear.<br>
In silence I have watched you<br>
comb your hair.<br>
Intimate the silence,<br>
dim and warm.<br>
I could but did not, reach<br>
to touch your arm.<br>
I could, but do not, break<br>
that which is still.<br>
(Almost the faintest whisper<br>
would be shrill.)<br>
So moments pass as though<br>
they wished to stay.<br>
We have not long to love.<br>
A night. A day....</p>
