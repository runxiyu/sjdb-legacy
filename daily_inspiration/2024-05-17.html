<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Something Childish, but Very Natural</b><br>
<cite>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</cite></p>
<p>If I had but two little wings<br>
And were a little feathery bird,<br>
To you I'd fly, my dear!<br>
But thoughts like these are idle things,<br>
And I stay here. </p>
<p> But in my sleep to you I fly:<br>
I'm always with you in my sleep!<br>
The world is all one's own.<br>
But then one wakes, and where am I?<br>
All, all alone.</p>
<p> Sleep stays not, though a monarch bids:<br>
So I love to wake ere break of day:<br>
For though my sleep be gone,<br>
Yet while 'tis dark, one shuts one's lids,<br>
And still dreams on.</p>
