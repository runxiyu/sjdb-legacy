<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Acrostic Anthology of Lonely Lines</b></p>
<p>Either in pain or thus in sympathy<br>
I believe life ends with death, and that is all.<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Shatter of glass; nothing more abrupt<br>
And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>
Much as you said you were.<br>
Kill me tomorrow; let me live tonight.<br>
Either in pain or thus in sympathy<br>
I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.<br>
The moon does wax, the moon does wane.</p>
</blockquote>
