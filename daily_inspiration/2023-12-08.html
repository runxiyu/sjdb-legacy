<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>The Rabbit Catcher</b><br>
<cite>Sylvia Plath</cite></p>
<p>I tasted the malignity of the gorse,<br>
Its black spikes,<br>
The extreme unction of its yellow candle-flowers.<br>
They had an efficiency, a great beauty,<br>
And were extravagant, like torture.</p>
