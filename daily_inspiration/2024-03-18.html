<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><small>Excerpt from</small><br>
<b>Ghazal 143</b><br>
<cite>Poem by <b>Hafez</b>, honored after death as Lisan Al-Gaib<br>
Translated by Dick Davis</cite></p>
<p>For years my heart inquired of me<br>
Where Jamshid's sacred cup might be,<br>
And what was in its own possession<br>
It asked from strangers, constantly;<br>
Begging the pearl that's slipped its shell<br>
From lost souls wandering by the sea.</p>
<p> Last night I took my troubles to<br>
The Magian sage whose keen eyes see<br>
A hundred answers in the wine<br>
Whose cup he, laughing, showed to me.</p>
<p>I asked him next, "And beauties' curls<br>
That tumble down so sinuously,<br>
What is their meaning? Whence do they come?"<br>
"Hafez," the sage replied to me,<br>
"It's your distracted, lovelorn heart<br>
That asks these questions constantly."</p>
