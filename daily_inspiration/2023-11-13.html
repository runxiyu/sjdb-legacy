<blockquote>
<p>This is a disaster. Look at the air, listen to the buzzing of the sun, the same as yesterday and the day before. Today is Monday too.</p>

<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Sonnet 5</b><br><cite>William Shakespeare</cite></p>
<p>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame<br>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,<br>
Will play the tyrants to the very same,<br>
And that un-fair which fairly doth excel:</p>
<p>For never-resting Time leads summer on<br>
To hideous winter, and confounds him there,<br>
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
Beauty o’er-snowed and bareness everywhere.</p>
<p>Then, were not summer’s distillation left<br>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
Beauty’s effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.</p>
<p>But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,<br>
Lose but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</p>
