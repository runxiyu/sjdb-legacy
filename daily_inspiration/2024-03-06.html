<h3>Poem of the Day 每日诗歌</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><b>50-50</b><br><cite>Langston Hughes</cite></p>
<p>I’m all alone in this world, she said,<br>
Ain’t got nobody to share my bed,<br>
Ain’t got nobody to hold my hand—<br>
The truth of the matter’s<br>
I ain’t got no man.</p>
<p>Big Boy opened his mouth and said,<br>
Trouble with you is<br>
You ain’t got no head!<br>
If you had a head and used your mind<br>
You could have <em>me</em> with you<br>
All the time.</p>
<p>She answered, Babe, what must I do?</p>
<p>He said, Share your bed—<br>
<em>And your money, too.</em></p>
