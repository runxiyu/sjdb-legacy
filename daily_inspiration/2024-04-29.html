<p>New satellite data shows that one-third of China's urban population is at risk of city-sinking.</p>
<p>Land subsidence, an overlooked urban hazard, is contributing to this phenomenon, along with rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Subsidence is mainly caused by human activities in cities, such as groundwater extraction and the weight of buildings.</p>
<p>Cities such as Tianjin and Shanghai are particularly affected, with Shanghai sinking by up to 3 meters over the past century. </p>
<p>Such research underscores the need for a national response. </p>
